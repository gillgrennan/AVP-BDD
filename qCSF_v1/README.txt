quick CSF Demo Software Package (version 1.0)

This MATLAB code complements the quick CSF method presented in:

Lesmes, Lu, Baek, & Albright (2010). Bayesian Adaptive 
Estimation of Contrast Sensitivity Functions: the quick CSF (qCSF) method 
Journal of Vision

These files provide a MATLAB implementation of the quick CSF method. The 
qCSF demo presented in the JOV paper (Movie 1) is generated by 'qCSF_Demo.m'. 
This program is heavily commented and provides the best view of how the
programs below are used in the context of a CSF experiment or simulation.
In addition to this readme file, the unzipped package should contain 
11 MATLAB files:


1. qCSF_Demo.m
2. setupQCSF.m
3. setupSimulation.m
4. setupPriors.m
5. runQCSF_BETA.m
6. quickCSF.fig
7. quickCSFv6.fig 
8. findQCSF.m
9. discretesamplev6.m
10. fitSechCost.m
11. marginalize.m

To summarize these files:

1. qCSF_Demo.m

	The main demo file.
	To run, open MATLAB, change your current 
	directory, and type 'qCSF_Demo':

2. setupQCSF.m
3. setupSimulation.m
4. setupPriors.m

	These three programs, called at the beginning of 'qCSF_Demo.m', 
	setup different features of a qCSF application. It might be
	useful to change and rename these files for different 
	experiments or experimental setups: e.g. setupQCSF_rig1.m, 
	or setupPriors_Amblyopes.m


5. runQCSF_BETA.m

	This file, which contains the qCSF "engine", is called for 
	trial-to-trial business: pre- and post-trial analyses and plotting. 
	Type 'help runQCSF_BETA' for more details about usage. 
 

6. quickCSF.fig
7. quickCSFv6.fig
 
	These .fig files are used for plotting simulation or experiment results.	
	Different .fig files are called depending on your MATLAB version.


8.  findQCSF.m
9.  discretesamplev6.m
10. fitSechCost.m
11. marginalize.m
	
	These are short useful files that are called to generate CSFs from
	CSF parameters(findQCSF.m), or to manipulate (generate, sample, marginalize) the
	parameter probability distributions used for Bayesian inference.
